# NeuralNetwork-Foundations
Welcome to the NeuralNetwork-Foundations repository! 

This repository serves as a comprehensive guide and implementation resource for individuals looking to learn and understand the foundations of neural networks, machine learning, and deep learning. 

## About

The purpose of this repository is to provide beginners with a solid understanding of the fundamental concepts and building blocks of neural networks. It covers a range of topics including fundamental algorithms like linear regression, logistic regression, etc. to CNN and transformers. It will also add evaluation metrics as the next stage of the project. 

Code + Mathematics behind algorithms + examples and more.
