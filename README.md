# DeepLearning-Concepts-Code
Work in progress. This repository is aimed to help student learn implementation of basics concepts of deep learning in python and PyTorch. 

We are open to collaboration. Please reach out to krmayankb@gmail.com if you want to help in setting up this repository structure.
Alternatively, you can open a PR and contribute to this repo. We will setup collaboration guidelines shortly. 

## Vision

A Repository that contains implementation of individual components of deep learning from scratch. We aim to help student and people who are new to the field understand the practical code of the modules. We will also add mathematical details in jupyter notebook. 

We understand this is currently raw but we, together, can make this go-to repository for learners.
